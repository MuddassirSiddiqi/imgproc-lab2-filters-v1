# Image Processing Lab 2 â€“ Filters (Version 1)

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental image processing filters, developed as part of an academic laboratory exercise. The focus is on applying and analyzing various filtering techniques to enhance and interpret digital images.

## Repository Structure

* `ex1.m`: MATLAB script implementing the first set of filtering techniques.
* `ex2.m`: MATLAB script implementing the second set of filtering techniques.
* `STAN.jpeg`: Sample image used for testing and demonstration purposes.
* `Test Image.jpeg`: Additional sample image for filter application and analysis.
* `README.md`: Documentation outlining the project's objectives and usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* MATLAB R2020a or later.
* Image Processing Toolbox.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuddassirSiddiqi/imgproc-lab2-filters-v1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd imgproc-lab2-filters-v1
   ```
3. Open MATLAB and add the project directory to the MATLAB path.
4. Run the desired script:

   ```matlab
   run('ex1.m');
   ```

   or

   ```matlab
   run('ex2.m');
   ```

## Features

* Implementation of spatial domain filters.
* Application of frequency domain filtering techniques.
* Visualization of filtering effects on sample images.
